Our project is about price forecasting of used cars. We called data from the used car market, where we could see various aspects of the car, such as manufacturer name, model name, color, milages, transmission and so on. After removing some unnecessary columns, three histogram graphs were drawn. Then we digitized the various categories in the dataset to get more accurate correlation. using random forest model, we divided the data in the dataset into 20% of the test set and 80% of the training set, and got our prediction results and obtained the important feature variables by integration. In addition, in order to cope with different market conditions, three other prediction models were made, all of which can get machine predicted used car prices that can compare well with the market situation.
